Bullet Point 1: ✔️ ORGANIC & NON-GMO: Blanched Roasted Hazelnuts by Food to Live are Organic and Non-GMO. Moreover, they’re Kosher and contain no sodium or cholesterol.
Bullet Point 2: ✔️ BLANCHED-DRY ROASTED-UNSALTED: Our Organic Filberts are first blanched (meaning, their skin is removed), then are gently dry roasted in the oven. They contain no salt and are perfectly crunchy without any bitterness.
Bullet Point 3: ✔️ KETO & VEGAN FRIENDLY: Roasted Organic Hazelnuts are low in carbs, thus are suitable for Keto, Vegan, and Vegetarian diets.
Bullet Point 4: ✔️ HIGHLY NUTRITIOUS: Food to Live Organic Blanched Roasted Filberts are incredibly rich in Potassium, Magnesium, Phosphorus, and Folate. Moreover, they contain a fair amount of Calcium, and Vitamins E and A.
Bullet Point 5: ✔️ SNACK & INGREDIENT: Roasted Blanched Hazelnuts can be eaten as a snack right out of the bag. They’re excellent nuts to add to baked goodies and homemade confectionery. Chop them up and use as a topping for salads, yogurt, and oatmeal, or add to sports nutrition bars and granola.
Product Description: f you want a quick and filling snack packed with fiber and essential vitamins and minerals, Organic Roasted Blanched Hazelnuts are a good option. These nuts are delicious on their own, but you can also use them to enrich the flavor of many dishes and baked goods. Blanched whole hazelnuts do not have the skin, which makes them taste milder than raw nuts. That’s because the skins are naturally bitter. Of course, you can blanch the nuts yourself, but those skins cling tight. Therefore, trying to make Organic Blanched Hazelnuts at home would be a challenge. How to Enjoy Organic Roasted Blanched Hazelnuts You don’t have to eat them as a snack from the pack in order to enjoy the delicious natural flavor of hazelnuts. Some dishes, like oatmeal, bring out the flavor of the nut. Therefore, sprinkling some roasted unsalted hazelnuts onto your morning oatmeal or other cereal is sure to be a good idea. Try to experiment with various recipes and use Organic Blanched Hazelnuts when baking. They would add flavor and crunch to cookies, granola, and cakes. And if you plan to add chocolate to the recipe as well, the taste would be even better. Using Organic Roasted Hazelnuts in homemade chocolates is a must if you want to create an amazing confectionery. Blanched Roasted Hazelnuts have a richer flavor than raw because of the roasting. That’s why they make such a great snack without any additives at all. They also make for an excellent ingredient in salads. There are also some soup recipes that could use some hazelnuts. If you love to experiment with flours, you can grind these nuts into meal and make some incredible hazelnut cookies.

Bullet Point 1: Fresh Peruvian Vanilla Beans from Late 2024 - 2025 Crop Suistainably Sourced From Peruvian Farmers at Fair Market Prices
Bullet Point 2: Length is ~ 5 - 6 Inches (Approximately 13-15 cm) with an average moisture content of 28% - 33% meaning these beans are soft, semi-pliable, and filled with millions of tiny vanilla seeds.
Bullet Point 3: Uses: Vanilla beans can be used in a variety of recipes as flavoring or ingredients and other uses such as homemade vanilla extract, baking, cooking, and brewing
Bullet Point 4: Peruvian Vanilla Beans Have a Tantalizing Aroma Characterized by Sweet, Floral, and Creamy Notes Adding Intriguing Complexity to Your Recipes.
Bullet Point 5: Our triple inspection process ensures only the highest quality beans are sent out by checking the size, smell, aroma, and appearance before packaging in our commercial vacuum sealers.
Product Description: Vanilla beans originated in Mexico and are sun cured for months using the traditional Bourbon drying method. They are now found all over the world from places like Madagascar to Indonesia to Papa New Guinea PNG farms. The scent consists of a heavenly buttery aroma with a rich, black or dark brown color and a very oily outside surface. The interior of the bean is where the magic is at and consists of millions of black, tiny vanilla seeds that are waiting to be scraped out. Our beans are traditionally cured to develop the full, complex vanilla flavor made of over 200 organic compounds and artificial vanilla (vanillin) cannot properly replicate the complexity of natural vanilla. The entire process takes anywhere from 6 to 9 months after pollination and our farmers have turned vanilla processing and curing into an art. This region remains the industry quality benchmark for producing vanilla planifolia with high vanillin content. <br><br>There are so many recipes that can be created with vanilla beans! Desserts such as vanilla bean ice cream, creme brulee, cup cakes, or cookies can be created with these magical beans. Homemade KAHLUA or Vanilla Extract is also a very popular gift & can be made using a simple vodka infusion method! Bonus points for using the spent vanilla beans after the extract making process for creating vanilla sugar!<br><br>Our beans are triple inspected throughout their journey. First, they are inspected by our farmers who have hundreds of years of experience. The second inspection is before bulk storage for transport. The final inspection is done at our warehouse moments before packing your shipment where we check the smell, quality, and appearance.

For one, food historians have been unable to track down a recipe for Pecan Pie older than 1925.

One cup of cooked organic kasha will provide you with: - B vitamins - Vitamin K - Vitamin E - Calcium - Manganese - Phosphorus - Magnesium - Zinc - Iron - Copper - Selenium One of the great things about organic buckwheat kernels is that you don’t have to pre-soak them before cooking.

This will make them mushy by the time you are actually finished cooking. You can enjoy organic kasha in many ways. Use it as a breakfast cereal or as an ingredient in a delicious main dish, cooked pilaf-style. You can mill grains into buckwheat flour and enjoy making organic buckwheat crepes and pancakes. They taste incredible and are lower in calories than wheat products. Organic buckwheat kernels are also safe to use in any gluten-free baking project.

The Native Americans have been eating this grain for millennia and the arrival of Spanish conquistadores spread this incredible plant all over the world. Today, corn is one of the most important foods in the world. Many programs aiming to fight world hunger rely on this particular plant due to the ease of its cultivation and high nutritional value.<p>Food To Live Organic Corn allows you to enjoy this delicious and healthy grain anytime. You can buy it in bulk and it will safely wait in your pantry until you feel like cooking some corn dish. This is a desire that one should encourage, as organic corn is a very good cooking ingredient. It contains quite a lot of nutrients as well as dietary fiber and protein.<p>Corn is used in many industries, including pharmaceuticals where corn starch is one of the most common additives. A single bushel of sweet corn can be turned into 32 pounds of starch or 33 pounds of sweetener. It can also be used to create 2.5 gallons of ethanol fuel.<p><b>Food To Live Organic Corn: Non-GMO and 100% Safe</b><p>Food To Live Organic Corn comes from farmers who use only the best agricultural practices to ensure the health of both their produce and the land.

Product Description: <p><strong>About Kopi Luwak:</strong>&nbsp;To produce Kopi Luwak, coffee berries are eaten by wild Luwak cat. In the stomach of these animals, the berries encounter proteolytic enzymes, which react with the coffee bean to remove acidity and change the flavor profile. After the Luwak excretes the beans, the farmers from Kaya Kopi collect them. Then, the outer layer of each bean is removed, and the beans are carefully clean, sun-dried and roasted. By the time you receive your Luwak coffee, it is 100% clean and safe to consume. Noticeably not bitter, Kaya Kopi Luwak is intensely aromatic with a complex flavor profile that is smooth, earthy and sweet with a hint of chocolate. It is a taste no coffee fan should miss. There is no need for sugar or other ingredients to cover the natural bitterness of coffee.</p> <ul> <li>Kaya Kopi Luwak starts its life at 4,000 feet (1,200 M) above sea level in the heart of the Pangalengan Highlands of West Java, Indonesia</li> <li>Kopi Luwak coffee is the ideal drink for visits from special guests, to relax, or just to enjoy the perfect taste of the best coffee available. Please note: 100% of the coffee from Kaya Kopi comes from free-range wild Luwaks living a healthy life.</li> <li>We don't think any animal should be harmed because of us! Further, Kopi Luwak from wild civets tastes much better than from caged animals. This is because the free-living Luwaks eat only the ripest berries and also have a proper diet which maintains the right enzymes in their stomach to improve the coffee taste.</li> </ul>

Product Description: Wonders of the Apple Fruit No other fruit plays such a major part in the human history as apples. Almost every country has a legend that features this incredible, sweet fruit. It’s really not surprising seeing how there are more than 7,500 species of apple trees cultivated in the world today. These plants are highly resilient and spread around the world quite fast. It’s believed that they originate from Central Asia, although today they are grown all over the globe. Despite the fact that apple fruits only came to America with the first colonists, they’ve managed to take firm root in our culture and become a staple food for an average US kitchen. Raw apple fruits are used in a variety of ways, including the production of cider, apple butter, and apple jelly. They can be eaten raw when ripe or used for cooking delicious apple pies, crumbles, cakes, and many other desserts. These fruits can be used for making savory dishes as well, and a duck roasted with apples is one of the most amazing meals you can find. Apple fruits are used in the production of cosmetic products and often included in homemade beauty remedies. All Western cultures use apple fruits extensively, so there are at least several dishes based on them in every cuisine. One of the best things about these fruits is that they are as good dried as they are raw. Of course, both the taste and texture of dried apples is a bit different, but they are no less enjoyable or nutritious. Food To Live Dried Apples: Organic, No Sugar, No Freeze Dried Apples from Food To Live are sourced from trusted farmers and processed with love and care using top-quality equipment.

Bullet Point 2: Serving Options - Keto Chow Shake Mixes are great for real keto meal prep! Like a fine wine when you premix one of our keto meals, it truly gets better with time. Mix and eat right away, or better yet, store in the fridge for up to a week and it gets more delicious over time. Don't believe me? Try it!
Bullet Point 3: Nutritionally Complete - You're getting a meal that is nutritionally complete for anyone rocking the ketogenic diet. What does nutritionally complete mean? It means you're getting exactly ⅓ of your daily keto macro and micro nutrition requirements, even down to selenium. (Which most keto shakes lack)
Bullet Point 4: Customizable - A requirement for nutritional ketosis is ensuring You're Eating A High Fat Low Carb Diet; Keto Chow is convenient, easy, and customizable to your keto diet needs. Add your own fat source like avocado oil, heavy cream, or our personal favorite - melted butter. You pick your own adventure (calories) here!
Bullet Point 5: Electrolyte - Avoid Electrolyte Deficiencies By Keeping Up With Your Body’s Electrolyte Requirements. As your body becomes fat adapted and depleted of carbs, it has a tendency to need more electrolytes. Keto Chow shake mixes come with all of the electrolytes your body needs for a single meal.
Product Description: Keto Chow is complete nutrition for Nutritional Ketosis. It's a drink mix that quickly and easily makes a complete keto meal. It's not meant to replace your bacon and steak. Rather, it's targeted to replace the mundane meals; running to a meeting, breakfast in the car, stuck in class, etc... By design, Keto Chow provides 1/3 of your daily needs for electrolytes, vitamins, protein and more. The aim is that you could replace all your meals without ill effect if you are so inclined, but most users replace 1-2 meals a day and have a fantastic keto meal with family or friends for the 3rd. It's also quite tasty with a range of great flavors. You combine the powdered mix with your own personal amount of heavy cream and/or avocado oil to get the calories you want, anywhere from 600 calories a day up to 4000 if you really want to! Many liken the taste and texture to melted ice cream or a milkshake.
